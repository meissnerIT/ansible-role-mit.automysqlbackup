You can choose the version:

* automysqlbackup_VERSION=2.6 will install the standard version from Debian.
* automysqlbackup_VERSION=3.0 will install a newer version manually (#20870). This version also supports purging old, deprecated backup files (which won't have the prefix "daily_") created by 2.6.
